                |   Benevolence doesn't usually translate to wealth, therefore you need to question where the education dollar is spent.
                |   More and more graduates are faced with years of paying staggering monthly payments, and many are starting to ask themselves, "Is it worth it?"

                |   Jobs that require a particularly high level of task flexibility, or creativity, or empathy may continue to employ people (for a while). Yet most office jobs will eventually be replaced by software automation.
                |   The world is always changing and technology is constantly making our lives easier. But with this great technology comes great job loss. (Ouch.)

                |   If you have any interest in mathematics, engineering, or the hard sciences, now is the time to explore it. Many subjects you can study in college — like history, literature, languages, business, law, or art — are also subjects you could learn later, through personal or professional experience, or through independent reading.
                |   Start working through difficult problems. If you don't tackle them now, the odds are strongly against you ever doing so in the future. We engineered the Which Degree product, and we'd like to share that with you.
